Siege of Dragonspear to Baldur's Gate 2:Enhanced Edition

First and foremost:  A HUGE thanks to Jastey for helping me to learn WeiDu!
		     This mod would'nt have happened otherwise.

Version 0.4.0


Purpose of this mod:

To provide a much larger selection of items and upgrade options for them, many with 
unique abilities and effects, to allow for more replay value.

What this mod does:

This mod imports additional items from Seige of Dragonspear, and provides
an upgrade path for these items along with most of the other SoD items that can 
normally be imported via cromwell and cespenar.  The newly added items
will be present regardless of whether you import a character or game from SoD.  I highly reccomend 
playing through SoD and collecting these items normally, as it will give a 
greater appreciation for this mod, as some of the dialogues with cromwell and cespy
reference where the items came from, who made them, etc.  I included one importable item from vanilla Baldur's Gate:EE
That can import into BG2 that I always felt should have had a brighter future in terms 
of being able to upgrade it.  I'm not going to give it away here because I would
like for it to be somewhat of a surprise.  I will give a hint: it can be found in Irenicus' dungeon on a table.
I might expand upon this during later updates, but for now I wish to focus on SoD items.

All of the new recipes have been added to both Cromwell and Cespenar, so you will not
run into a situation where if you missed something in SoA you are prevented from
upgrading it in ToB.  Many of the new recipes require components that are used
to upgrade other items in game, forcing the player into an either/or choice for
greater replability and challenge.   Even though some of the upgrade components cannot be
acquired until ToB, Cromwell still has the recipes and can perform the upgrades.  I did this to
ensure that in the event a player has the components somehow (for instance, EEKeeper or if a future update moves them to an accessible SoA location),
they could upgrade the item without having to wait until ToB.

Starting in the 0.2.0 update, entirely new item components have been added into the game to use in some of the upgrade recipes.
I dont want to spoil their locations, but they shouldnt be too hard to find.

Starting with 0.4.0 I have added an optional component that will force the items that can normally be imported from SoD to 
be present in their normal locations.  (you must start a new game for this to work)  The way this component works is to set the global variables for all importable
SoD items as if you had imported an SoD game that had them all.  Since the Voidsowrd +3 and Voidhammer +3 are mututally exclusive 
(you cant import both normally) you will be given the option during installation to choose which one to import.
With the global variables for all the item active, the existing game scripts will see them when you enter an area
where one of the SoD items would be and place them as it normally would.  Doing it this way prevents the possibility of duplicates.

****NOTE**** during my testing, I discovered an unlikely, but potential issue that also happens even if you dont use this mod:
The area script to place SoD items in their normal locations runs when you first enter an area.  Because of this, it is *techincally*
possible for you to kill the monster or NPC holding one of these items before the script completes, which results in the default
item dropping instead.  For example, if you somehow were to enter firkraag's maze from his hideout, and immediately kill Tazok as
quickly as possible (such as with a godbow or something else that one-shots everything), the script wont have time to complete
and the Dragon Blade +3 wont drop.  This should only happen in extreme cases, but if you run into an instance where you didnt get the 
SoD item expected, all you have to do is reload and wait a couple of seconds after entering the area containing the item.

These items have been placed in logical (at least to me) locations around Shadows of Amn.  
I dont want to spoil the locations, as I've always felt discovery is part of what makes new things fun, 
But if you think about it from the perspective that your gear was sold off or traded away, that's how I determined placement.
