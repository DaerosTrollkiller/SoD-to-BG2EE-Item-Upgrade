Siege of Dragonspear to Baldur's Gate 2:Enhanced Edition

First and foremost:  A HUGE thanks to Jastey for helping me to learn WeiDu!
		     This mod wouldnt have happened otherwise.

Version 0.2.4


Purpose of this mod:

This mod imports additional items from Seige of Dragonspear, and provides
an upgrade path for these items along with most of the other SoD items that can 
normally be imported via cromwell and cespenar.  If you do not have SoD, or a SoD 
save game to import, you can access them via EE keeper or the console.  I highly reccomend 
playing through SoD and collecting these items normally, as it will give a 
greater appreciation for this mod, as some of the dialogues with cromwell and cespy
reference where the items came from.  I included one importable item from vanilla Baldur's Gate:EE
That imports into BG2 that I always felt should have had a bighter future in terms 
of being able to upgrade it.  I'm not going to give it away here because I would
like for it to be somewhat of a surprise.  I will give a hint: it can be found in Irencus' dungeon.

All new recipes have been added to both Cromwell and Cespenar, so you will not
run into a situation where if you missed something in SoA you are prevented from
upgrading it in ToB.  Many of the new recipes require components that are used
to upgrade other items in game, forcing the player into an either/or choice for
greater replability and challenge.

Starting in the 0.2.0 update, entirely new item components have been added into the game to use in some of the upgrade recipes.
I dont want to spoil their locations, but they shouldnt be too hard to find.

These items have been placed in logical (at least to me) locations around Shadows of Amn.  
I dont want to spoil the locations, as I've always felt discovery is part of what makes new things fun, 
But if you think about it from the perspective that your gear was sold off or traded away, that's how I determined placement.

Tongue of Acid +3  (can be upgraded twice) (branching path starting with v0.2.0)
