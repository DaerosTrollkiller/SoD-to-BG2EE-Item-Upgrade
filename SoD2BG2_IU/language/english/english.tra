@2 = ~Let's see if ye got what I need to reforge that hellish blade of yours...~
@3 = ~Well, let's see what else ye got.~

@44 = ~I can reforge that unbalanced flamin' blade of yours, and make it a far more effective and balanced weapon.  I would just need a sword of flame, a blade of searing, and five scrolls of agannazar's scorcher.  7,500gp for the day's work at the forge and it'd be a done deal for ye.~
@45 = ~A flaming sword, a searing blade, and five of the scorcher scrolls.  I can get right to work on reforging that unweildy burning sword of yours if ye'd like.~

@58 = ~Scales from a shadow dragon?  I can use these to further enhance your armor.~
@59 = ~This be a nice greatsword ye have here, a dragon's gift?  She looks rather worn...~
@60 = ~I can use either these red dragon scales or shadow dragon scales to reforge your green dragonscale.~
@61 = ~It'll cost ye 15,000 gold and since me apprentice would rather chase harlots and courtesans than work, ye'll need to stay on a day and help me run the forge.~
@62 = ~Well, let's see what ye got then.~
@63 = ~I can reforge this blade, I would just need a sharp new blade for the forgin'.  A Githyanki's vorpal blade of silver would work best.~

@70 = ~Scales from a dragon of noble silver?  It saddens this old dwarf to know such a creature fell for these scales.  However, we shouldn't let them go to waste.  I can use these to improve your armor.~
@71 = ~Enhancing a vorpal blade be a tall order, I'd need an elemental gemstone for it, and 10,000gp to fit it to your sword.~
@72 = ~Scales from a blue dragon?  I can use these to enhance your armor.~
@73 = ~Looks like ye have an elemental gem of frost here, I can use this to enhance your dragon blade with.~

@82 = ~Ye have everything I need here to upgrade those stalker gauntlets of yers.  It'll be 10,000gp and I'll need yer help at me forge.  Me son of a kobald of an apprentice was out all hours deep in his cups with the blasted courtesans again.~
@83 = ~The Scorched Earth again eh?  Not hot enough for ye?  Heh.~
@84 = ~Be a difficult task to make this blade burn hotter... but I might just be able to do it for ye if'n ye can find me an elemental gem of flame.  Oh, and a small comission for me work, 15,000gp should cover it.  And lest I forget, I'll need yer help for the day at me forge.  That damnable apprentice of mine has gone and knocked up a half-orc lass.  I doubt I will ever see him again, heh.~
@85 = ~Looks like ye found an elemental gem of flame, they be rare as hen's teeth.  Shall we get started on mounting it into yer blade?~
@86 = ~What ye got here?  A lucky belt ye say?~
@87 = ~Methinks I can make this belt even more lucky for ye and yer friends with five scrolls of luck and 10,000gp.~
@88 = ~Ye have everything I need to fix up that lucky belt for ye, I'll just need yer help at the forge again.  That half orc lass did a real number on me apprentice, he's going to be laid up a few days at least, the scoundrel.  Shall we begin?~

@94 = ~Ye have another wand of fire and frost here too, shall we get to work?  Me apprentice is away on his honeymoon with the half-orc lass at the Low Lantern in Baldur's Gate, I'll need ye to help me again.~
@95 = ~Ahh, ye've got an old backwhacker here, I could use one of these for me bastard apprentice.  Just to keep 'im in line o' course.~
@96 = ~If'n ye come accross a wyvern tail and a gnasher club, I can reforge this backwhacker into a really nasty implement for a rogue.  I'd just need a mere 5,000gp for me trouble.~
@97 = ~Ye've got the wyvern tail and gnasher.  Ye ready to get started on the whacker?  Just one day's worth of yer help at me forge again if'n ye can.  Me apprentice is nursing a hangover he says, Pfft.~
