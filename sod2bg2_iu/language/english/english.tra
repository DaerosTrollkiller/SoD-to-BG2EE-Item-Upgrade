@1 = ~Ye know, I might be able to improve it with a blazing sword as fiery as the hells themselves and a scroll of disintegrate to reduce it to its essence.  Or I could use a Githyanki's silver hilt if'n ye could wrestle one away from the beasts.~
@2 = ~Let's see if ye got what I need to reforge that hellish blade of yours...~
@3 = ~Well, let's see what else ye got.~
@4 = ~Ah, the hellblade again eh?  Last time this damnable blade nearly ruined my best hammer!~
@5 = ~It be a tall order to improve this blade further, I'd need an elemental gemstone of ichor, along with 15,000gp for the work.~
@6 = ~This be the gemstone we need, I can improve that hellish blade with it if'n ye want.~

@9 = ~Ah, thats some liquid mercury alright, I can improve these boots with them.~
@10 = ~What've ye got here?  Hah! a crown of false gemstones and gold.  Still, it seems to have a bit o' enchantment to it.~
@11 = ~I could make this false crown ring true with real gemstones of emerald, diamond, star sapphire, a potion of insight and 5,000gp.~
@12 = ~This looks to be the gems I need, and the potion.  I can reforge that crown of yours into one fit for a king if ye'd like.~

@19 = ~This be a nice belt o' skill you have here, Keenedge's work if'n I'm not mistaken.~
@20 = ~Ol' Cromwell can make this belt even better for ye, I just need some gauntlets of weapon skill and expertise along with a scroll of distintegrate to transfer the magics and 10,000gp for the work.~
@21 = ~Ye got the gauntlets and scroll, I can get to work on improving Sa'yan's belt for ye if'n ye want.~
@22 = ~Nice sharp throwing dart ye have here, I almost pricked me fingers on it.~
@23 = ~I can improve this bloody dart of yours with five scrolls of melf's acid arrow, five sphene gems, and 5,000gp.~

@25 = ~Bloody hells!  Just touching this blade's hilt makes me feel as weak as a young lass!~
@26 = ~I cannae enhance this blade unless ye finds me a skull of dark power, mayhap a lich's.  And I would need 15,000gp for me trouble.~

@34 = ~What've ye got there, a Thayvian mage's robe?~
@35 = ~If'n ye happen to come across the robe of vecna, I can use its threading and magics to enhance that flamin' conjurer's robe of yours.  It would cost ye 10,000gp for the commission.~
@36 = ~I see ye've managed to get the old lich's robe, quite impressive.  I can use it to improve that Thayvian robe if'n ye want.~
@37 = ~What's this now?  One of the bucklers from those mercenaries at Baldur's Gate?~
@38 = ~This old dwarf can rework that Flaming Fist buckler of yours into something special if'n ye can provide me with a reflection shield +1, two scrolls of protection against normal missiles, two potions of mirrored eyes, and 10,000gp for me trouble.~

@40 = ~Is this?.... Hah!  It is!  The false "Crom Faeyr".  Where in the realms did you find this accursed thing?~
@41 = ~Hmmm, I might be able to improve that accursed hammer if'n you can find me a rune of clangeddin to scribe into it.  It would take 5,000gp fer the work.~
@42 = ~This be one of the clangeddin runes alright, I can use it to enhance that blasphemous hammer of yours.~
@43 = ~What've ye here?  The balance and heft of this burning blade be all wrong, was it even made to be held by mortal hands?~
@44 = ~I can reforge that unbalanced flamin' blade of yours, and make it a far more effective and balanced weapon.  I would just need a sword of flame, a blade of searing, and five scrolls of agannazar's scorcher.  7,500gp for the day's work at the forge and it'd be a done deal for ye.~
@45 = ~A flaming sword, a searing blade, and five of the scorcher scrolls.  I can get right to work on reforging that unweildy burning sword of yours if ye'd like.~
@46 = ~Ahhh, just lookin' at these boots reminds me of gazin' at the skies over the harbor at night.~
@47 = ~If'n ye want me to improve Crommus' old boots for ye, I'd need a few things.  Two potions each of magic protection, magic shielding, and magic blocking.~
@48 = ~Ye have all the potions I need here to reforge those starry boots, I would just need 5,000gp for me work at the forge.  Shall I get started on em for ye?~
@49 = ~Placeholder~

@57 = ~I can use these shadow dragon scales to reforge the green dragonscale into a lightweight scale armor.~
@58 = ~Scales from a shadow dragon?  I can use these to further enhance your armor.~
@59 = ~This be a nice greatsword ye have here, a dragon's gift?  She looks rather worn...~
@60 = ~I can use either these red dragon scales or shadow dragon scales to reforge your green dragonscale.~
@61 = ~It'll cost ye 15,000 gold and since me apprentice would rather chase harlots and courtesans than work, ye'll need to stay on a day and help me run the forge.~
@62 = ~Well, let's see what ye got then.~
@63 = ~I can reforge this blade, I would just need a sharp new blade for the forgin'.  A Githyanki's vorpal blade of silver would work best.~
@64 = ~Ahh yes, this be a vorpal blade alright, I can use it to reforge that dragon's sword of yours, along with 7,500 gold for me trouble.~
@65 = ~The Verdant Crimson Dragon Plate?  Ye wish to improve it further, eh?~

@69 = ~Scales from a white dragon? I can use these to further enhance your armor.~
@70 = ~Scales from a dragon of noble silver?  It saddens this old dwarf to know such a creature fell for these scales.  However, we shouldn't let them go to waste.  I can use these to improve your armor.~
@71 = ~Enhancing a vorpal blade be a tall order, I'd need an elemental gemstone for it, and 10,000gp to fit it to your sword.~
@72 = ~Scales from a blue dragon?  I can use these to enhance your armor.~
@73 = ~Looks like ye have an elemental gem of frost here, I can use this to enhance your dragon blade with.~

@81 = ~Always wanted to try me hand at reforgin a pair o' these, and I believe I can do it for ye with a bracers of blinding strike, an improved haste scroll, two potions of power and two potions of master thievery.~
@82 = ~Ye have everything I need here to upgrade those stalker gauntlets of yers.  It'll be 10,000gp and I'll need yer help at me forge.  Me son of a kobald of an apprentice was out all hours deep in his cups with the blasted courtesans again.~
@83 = ~The Scorched Earth again eh?  Not hot enough for ye?  Heh.~
@84 = ~Be a difficult task to make this blade burn hotter... but I might just be able to do it for ye if'n ye can find me an elemental gem of flame.  Oh, and a small comission for me work, 15,000gp should cover it.  And lest I forget, I'll need yer help for the day at me forge.  That damnable apprentice of mine has gone and knocked up a half-orc lass.  I doubt I will ever see him again, heh.~
@85 = ~Looks like ye found an elemental gem of flame, they be rare as hen's teeth.  Shall we get started on mounting it into yer blade?~
@86 = ~What've ye got here?  A lucky belt ye say?~
@87 = ~Methinks I can make this belt even more "lucky" for ye and yer friends with five scrolls of luck and 10,000gp.~
@88 = ~Ye have everything I need to fix up that lucky belt for ye, I'll just need yer help at the forge again.  That half orc lass did a real number on me apprentice, he's going to be laid up a few days at least, the scoundrel.  Shall we begin?~
@89 = ~Now this is an odd bird, a cursed staff that's uncursed...but still cursed?~

@92 = ~Ahh, yer accursed stick again, ye would like to have it recharged ye say?~
@93 = ~Ol' Cromwell might be able to work some more magic into that old stick with another wand of fire, a wand of frost, and another 5,000gp for me trouble.~
@94 = ~Ye have another wand of fire and frost here too, shall we get to work?  Me apprentice is away on his honeymoon with the half-orc lass at the Low Lantern in Baldur's Gate, I'll need ye to help me again.~
@95 = ~Ahh, ye've got an old backwhacker here, I could use one of these for me bastard apprentice.  Just to keep 'im in line o' course.~
@96 = ~If'n ye come accross a wyvern tail and a gnasher club, I can reforge this backwhacker into a really nasty implement for a rogue.  I'd just need a mere 5,000gp for me trouble.~
@97 = ~Ye've got the wyvern tail and gnasher.  Ye ready to get started on the whacker?  Just one day's worth of yer help at me forge again if'n ye can.  Me apprentice is nursing a hangover he says, Pfft.~
@98 = ~Hmm, be this bow of orcish origin?  Looks to be quite frightening.~
@99 = ~I can make this banshee's bow wail upon your enemies for you, I would just need something like some screaming bagpipes to make it do so, along with a bowstring of gesen or gond to hold it all together.~
@100 = ~I would need 10,000gp and yer help fer the day.  Me apprentice managed to smash his hand with me anvil and will be laid up fer awhile.~
@101 = ~I can use this Githyanki hilt to reforge that devil's sword if ye would like, it would cost ye 10,000 gold fer the work.~

@103 = ~Hmm, looks like ye have the hilt, and the blazing sword and scroll too, I could use either to reforge that devil's blade if ye would like.  Just toss me 10,000 gold for me coffers and I'll get started~
@104 = ~It doesn't look like ye have what I need to reforge that hellblade...~
@105 = ~Let's see if ye got all I need to rework this orcish bow...~ 
@106 = ~I can use this gesen bowstring along with yer bagpipes to improve your bow.~
@107 = ~I can use this bowstring of gond along with yer bagpipes to improve your bow.~
@108 = ~Quite the adventurer you must be to have bowstrings from gond and gesen.~
@109 = ~Ye have some of the parts here, but I'll need the screaming pipes along with one of the gond or gesen bowstrings to complete the work.~
@110 = ~I'd need 10,000gp and yer help fer the day at me forge.~
@111 = ~Nice gloves ye got here, just in me size too!~
@112 = ~I can reforge these gloves for ye and make them a better fit too with some extra materials. Mayhap some bracers of archery, a bracers of defense AC3, some gloves of pickpocketing and 5,000gp for the stitchwork.~
@113 = ~Looks like ye got all the materials I need to reforge yer doeskin gloves, Ye up for another day o' work with me at me shop?~
@114 = ~What've ye here....a blackened arrow that seems to sap the strength right from me arm...~
@115 = ~I can make ye more of these arrows, mayhap even an unlimited supply with the right components.  I would just need on of yer arrows, a quiver of plenty +2 and 5,000 gold.~

@123 = ~Hmmm, very nice dagger ye got here, imbued with all the elements at once?~
@124 = ~Ye know, this dagger o' yers would be much more useful if'n ye could throw it.  I could improve it as such with a boomerang dagger and 5,000gp fer the forgin'.~
@125 = ~Ye have a boomerang dagger here, I can use it to enhance that elemental dagger.  Me apprentice didn't show up again today, so I will need yer help fer the day.~
@126 = ~Ah, the elemental dagger again, ye want it further enhanced?~
@127 = ~Enhancing this elemental dagger is a tall order, ye would need to find me an elemental gem to use with it.~
@128 = ~I can use the Soul of Frost to enhance yer elemental dagger, I just need 5,000gp and yer help at the forge.~
@129 = ~Ach!  Ye should warn a dwarf before ye hand him a blasted pike that shocks ye!~
@130 = ~I could reforge the storm pike if'n ye find me a wave shaft to work with.~

@140 = ~I could reforge this inoun stone for ye, it needs a warrior's spirit to focus the power inside.  If'n ye can somehow find a pale green ioun stone in yer travels, I could use it, along with five scrolls of resist fear, and five potions of regeneration, and five potions of heroism to enhance yer ioun stone.~

@163 = ~Scales from a green dragon?  I can use these to further enhance your armor.~
@164 = ~Ye say ye would like yer dragonscale shield made sturdier?~
@165 = ~Hmmm, it would take some extremely tough scales to improve this shield, only some from a black dragon would work.~
@166 = ~Ye certainly are a brave one to have slain a black dragon for these scales.  I can use these to enhance yer shield.  I would need 7,500gp fer the commission, shall we begin work?~

@172 = ~Ye've gone and slain a black dragon 'ave ye?  These scales will do nicely for your Iriaeborian leathers.   Just a toss 7,500gp in fer me coffers and I'll get to work for ye.~
@173 = ~Ey?  What be this?  Some accursed bard's bracers?~
@174 = ~Hmmm, ye know, ol' Cromwell may be able to make these jokers' bracers better for ye.  It'd take some dark magic though.  I'd need to use the power from two demon's hearts along with 5,000gp fer me trouble, and I cannae gaurantee the curse would be lifted.~
@175 = ~Well now, ye've gone and carved two hearts from demons.  I'll not ask ye where from, but if'n ye would like me to use em to enhance those bracers of yers, I'll get to work right away.~
@176 = ~Ye have a blessed ring here, do ye?  Did ye pluck this one from Strohm's tomb?  I cannae hardly believe me eyes.~

@182 = ~Hmm, very interesting blade ye have here, quite cold to the touch, and seething with anger.  This be one of the old Sharran blades ye say?~
@183 = ~Aye, I can enhance this blade for ye, it needs something to balance and focus the raw anger from the spirit trapped within.  I'd need either the blade or hilt from the ancient sword, Equalizer, if'n ye can find them.~
@184 = ~Let me rummage through yer pack and see if ye have something I can use to enhance this dark blade for ye...~
@185 = ~Ah, ye've gone and found the blade of the Equalizer, I can use this to enhance that dead priestess' blade of yours.~
@186 = ~Ah, ye've gone and found the hilt of the Equalizer, I can use this to enhance that dead priestess' blade of yours.~
@187 = ~Quite the treasure hunter ye be, having located both the hilt and blade of the Equalizer.  I can use either to enhance Varscona for ye.~

@189 = ~I would just need the blade and 5,000gp for the commission to do the work.~
@190 = ~The Varscona +3?  Ye would like it further enhanced?  Quite a feat to enhance this blade further methinks...~
@191 = ~Aye, I can enhance the dark blade further, but I would need an elemental gemstone of frost to do so.~
@192 = ~Ye have the Soul of Frost here, I can use this to reforge Varscona +3 into a far more powerful blade, I would just need 10,000gp for the work and yer help for the day once again at me forge.~
@193 = ~It cannae be.... a magical axe from the lost Stonfire clan!  It was here in Athkatla in some blasted tavern, ye say?~
@194 = ~It'd be a right honor to enhance this fine piece o' dwarven craftsmanship for ye.  To do so would take nothing less than an elemental gemstone of flame and 10,000 gold crowns.~
@195 = ~Aye, this is certainly a gemstone of flame ye have here, shall we get to work on yer axe?~
@196 = ~Ah, this looks to be some scrappy ol' wizard's hat...~
@197 = ~If'n ye would like to have this old hat enhanced, it'd take some potent magics.  Methinks it would take the Circlet of Netheril, nothing less.~

@202 = ~What be this? looks to be an unfinished garment constructed of human skin?  I'll not ask ye where ye got this from.~
@203 = ~With the right components, I could finish this ghastly thing into a completely serviceable piece of armor.  If ye are able to pry Vecna's robes from Ribald's greedy fingers, and find me some blood from a shadow dragon, I could finish the work.~
@204 = ~This be the old Lich's robe sure enough, and by the Soul Forger... is this murky vial filled with the life-blood from a Shadow Drake?  Such a sight to behold, it's almost as if this be bled from the very void itself.  With these, and a generous contribution of 10,000 gold crowns for the forgin' I will get to work on that fleshy garment for ye right away.~
@205 = ~Ye say ye would like the Lich's Raiment improved even further?  This be a tall order, even for me...~

@207 = ~Ye never cease to amaze this old dwarf.  How in the nine hells did ye come across this skull?  Never ye mind, it's not important.  If ye can suffer the loss of 10,000 more gold crowns, I can use this skull to improve that ghoulish mage armor of yers.~
@208 = ~What's this now? Some dusty old parchment?  Ah, ye have quite the find here friend, tis a majick-locked scroll, likely containing something special, eh?~
@209 = ~Me granda taught me a thing or two about these scrolls, and I can remove the seal for ye, if'n ye make it worth me while.  Bring me some scales from a chromatic dragon, any color will do, and we can speak further on yer scroll.~
@210 = ~Aye, ye've brought me some scales from those evil, overgrown lizards.  I can use these in unsealing that scroll of yers.~

@220 = ~Ye say ye would like this blade improved?  Aye, I can do it, but I'll need something special.  If'n ye can find me a a gemstone of light, I can use it to rework that crimson blade.~
@221 = ~A gemstone of pure light.... rather impressive ye be in the art of adventurin'.  With this and 5,000 gold pieces, I can reforge yer blade.~
@222 = ~Ah, ye've got a nicely balanced old fighter's blade here, seen alot of use.... ye would like it reforged?~
@223 = ~Aye, I can reforge this blade for ye, I would need something to give it a bit more pep... a gemstone of light would to the trick.~
@224 = ~This be a gemstone of brilliant light alright, I can use this to reforge that fighter's blade of yours, it would set ye back a mere 5,000 gold coins and a day's worth of yer help at me forge.~
@225 = ~Ah, the Kara-Turan blade of legend again, eh?  Ye say ye would like it enhanced further?~
@226 = ~Aye, I can enhance it, but an unearthly blade requires unearthly ore to reforge.  Nothing less than starfall ore would do the trick.~
@227 = ~This ore certainly be of unearthly origin, I can use this to reforge that red katana of yours.  A simple 10,000 golden coins from your coffers would seal the deal.~
@228 = ~The Severance +3?  A blade this well balanced be tough to enhance any further....~
@229 = ~If'n ye can somehow find me some ore from the heavens, I can reforge yer blade with it.~
@230 = ~Aye, this be ore from the stars alright, I can use it to enhance that old fighter's blade of yers.  I would just need 10,000 gold pieces and a day's worth of yer help at me forge.~

The bard sat up, healed of all wounds and bestowed with a valuable gift. The unicorn vanished into the trees, and the bard found the horn bestowed healing powers whenever she played it.

He requested Cromwell to forge him a suit of armor made from the shells so that he could return home to face the shopkeeper-mage who had betrayed his neighbors.  Unfortunately, the fishmonger could not afford the commission.  Not wanting to send away someone in such dire need, Cromwell agreed to make the armor if the fishmonger would allow him to keep a small portion of shell for himself.  Cromwell then used the shell to forge a new helmet for himself, as he knew it would provide greater protection against magical misfires at his forge.   No one knows what ever happened to the fishmonger or the unique suit of Remorhaz armor, it is most likely he was waylaid by bandits on his return trip and the armor stolen.

After explaining her situation and pleading for help, Cromwell agreed to perform a dangerous and rare enchantment on the djinn's lamp to reverse the relationship between master and servant.  Once he caught up to her, the enfuriated Vizier immediately used his powerful magics to wrest the lamp from the djinn.  In his haste, he immediately rubbed the lamp to trap the djinn.  Much to his dismay, he was drawn into the lamp against his will, imprisoning himself and freeing the djinn.  The grateful djinn gifted this hammer to Cromwell before returning to Calimshan.  Over the years, Cromwell has used this hammer to forge many powerful magic items, and its power has grown as magics continue to seep slowly into it from his works.

Much to his delight, the creation of the spell was successful and put to great use during his troll-cleansing campaign.  In the years following, as Durlag's madness took hold of him, he kept all of his most prized possessions, including this spell, under lock, key, and devious trap inside his tower.  How it came to be in your possession is a mystery.   When cast, a raging ball of flame flies forth from the caster's hand, striking the target point and exploding in a horrific display of hellfire, doing 1d6 points of damage for each level of the spellcaster (up to a maximum of 16d6) to targets caught in the blast.  The searing heat is so intense that it can ignite clothing, armor, and even flesh, causing an additional 1d4 fire damage per round and sending the afflicted into a state of panic until they successfully roll a Save vs. Spell to extinguish the flames.  Those who roll successful a Save vs. Spell manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, taking only half damage from the inital blast, and evade the ongoing fire damage and panic.  All saving throws must be made at -2.~

The chosen of Auril speak of this spell as legend, a power that the Ice Maiden bestows only upon her most blessed, and is a closely guarded secret.  It is said this spell conjures forth the very breath of Auril herself.  Cold as the hearts of Auril's followers may be, there are beings far, far more cruel than they in the realms, and it is rumored that one such being, known as "The Shattered One", caputured a high priestess of Auril and performed torturous experiments on her to "extract" knowledge of this magic for his own use.  Why or how the scroll containing this magic came to be in your hands is unknown, nor is the fate of the Aurilite priestess.  This spell brings forth a gale of icy, frozen wind from the caster's hands, feezing all in it's path with 1d5+1 of cold damage per level, up to a maximum of 20d5+20.   Those afflicted by the penetrating cold suffer from slowed reaction and movement, hindering their ability to fight unless a saving throw is made.   Those who roll a successful Save vs. Spell will shrug off a portion of the cold, taking half damage and avoiding stifled movement.  All saving throws must be made at -2.~

This spell conjures forth a thick, acrid, corrosive smog that immediately begins to dissolve the flesh and armor of any creature unfortunate enough to be caught in it.  Creatures caught in the area of effect will take 1d10 of acid damage per round that they remain in the caustic fog, and must roll a Saving Throw vs. Spells at a -4 penalty or suffer reduction to their resistances against all forms of physical damage 15% for three rounds.  These effects increase with the caster's level, up to a maximum of 1d10+5 acid damage and 20% reduction of physical damage resistance at level 17.~
